# imc_telegram_bot
telegram bot for our university group

calendar, reddit and grade notifier will NOT work without credentials and Oauth2.

* for the IMC account you can simply use your credentials and it should scrape the page without problems
* google calendar and reddit features won't work because they require client_id and client_secret and my reddit account. you need to create your clients through googles developer console and reddit developer page, for the calendar you need to add the imc calendar to your google calendar and then use its ID.
* the credentials which I didn't upload are 3 json files. I didn't upload the txt file which contains the grades, so on the first run it will notify with a grade that is already out.
